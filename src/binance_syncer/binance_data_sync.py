        Downloads a zipped CSV file from the given file_key, processes its data, and stores it in either S3 or locally.
        This asynchronous function performs the following operations:
        1. Uses a semaphore to limit concurrent downloads.
        2. Checks if the file (derived from file_key) already exists in S3 (if storage_mode is 's3') and skips downloading if it does.
        3. Attempts to download the file using the provided aiohttp ClientSession.
        4. Reads the downloaded zip file, extracts the contained CSV, and loads it into a pandas DataFrame.
            - If the data type matches one of the predefined headers in Headers, the CSV is read without a header and the columns are set accordingly.
            - In the case of KLINES data, specific timestamp columns ('open_time' and 'close_time') are parsed safely.
        5. Depending on the storage_mode:
            - For S3: Converts the DataFrame to parquet format and uploads it to the specified S3 bucket.
            - For local storage: Saves the DataFrame as a parquet file to the local filesystem.
        6. Implements exponential backoff and retries the download process up to max_retries times if any error occurs.
        Parameters:
                session (aiohttp.ClientSession): The HTTP session used for making asynchronous requests.
                symbol (str): The trading symbol associated with the data.
                file_key (str): The URL or identifier of the zipped file to download.
                semaphore (asyncio.Semaphore): Semaphore to limit concurrent execution.
                max_retries (int, optional): Maximum number of download attempts. Defaults to 3.
        Returns:
                bool: True if the download and storage process completes successfully; otherwise, False.
